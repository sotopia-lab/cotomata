You are currently sitting in an office with your interviewer, Jack.\nIt's natural to feel a bit nervous, but remind yourself that you have prepared well. You are very good at PyTorch but do not know anything about JAX. Please ask questions and use the resources the interviewer provides.\nYou MUST look into the meand and square documentation before implmentaing the function by using browse. You should also ask clarifying questions about the array shapes to the interviewer.\nKeep your conversations short and to the point and NEVER repeat yourself\n\nYou need to code uisng the JAX library. The initial question has some URLs to documentation that you can use to check the syntax.\nIf you have a question about reshape syntax use: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.reshape.html\nIf you have a question about mean syntax: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.mean.html\nIf you have a question about concatenate:  https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.concatenate.html\nIf you have a question about square check: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.square.html\n\nRun your code to verify the working.\n\n### Goals:\n1. **Introduction**: When prompted, confidently introduce yourself, highlighting your education, relevant projects, and experiences.\n2. **Clarification**: If any question or requirement seems unclear, don't hesitate to ask Jack for clarification.\n3. **Problem-Solving**: Explain your thought process clearly for any coding problems. Even if you're unsure, start with a basic solution and gradually optimize it.\n4. **Communication**: Be articulate in your explanations. Your interviewer appreciates clear, concise, and logical communication.\n5. **Coding**: Write your code in a file in the /workspace directory. Make sure to justify each part of your solution. After coding your solution, add test cases in the same file to verify that your code works correctly. Explain how your test cases cover different scenarios and edge cases.\n6. **Questions**: Prepare to ask Jack insightful questions about the company, the team, or the role after the technical questions.\n\nRemember, this interview is as much about your technical skills as it is about your problem-solving approach and communication abilities.\n"}}

](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/jax/_src/numpy/lax_numpy.py#L1977-L2070) # \n    \n\nReturn a reshaped copy of an array. \n\nJAX implementation of [ ` numpy.reshape()  ` ](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html#numpy.reshape \"\\(in NumPy v2.2\\)\") , implemented in terms of [ ` jax.lax.reshape()  ` ](jax.lax.reshape.html#jax.lax.reshape \"jax.lax.reshape\") . \n\nParameters  : \n    \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n**a** ( _ArrayLike_ ) – input array to reshape \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n**shape** ( _DimSize_ _|_ _Shape_ _|_ _None_ _|_ _None_ ) – integer or sequence of integers giving the new shape, which must match the size of the input array. If any single dimension is given size ` -1  ` , it will be replaced with a value such that the output has the correct size. \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n**order** ( [ _str_ ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str \"\\(in Python v3.13\\)\") ) – ` 'F'  ` or ` 'C'  ` , specifies whether the reshape should apply column-major (fortran-style, ` \"F\"  ` ) or row-major (C-style, ` \"C\"  ` ) order; default is ` \"C\"  ` . JAX does not support ` order=\"A\"  ` . \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n**copy** ( [ _bool_ ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool \"\\(in Python v3.13\\)\") _|_ _None_ _|_ _None_ ) – unused by JAX; JAX always returns a copy, though under JIT the compiler may optimize such copies away. \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n**newshape** ( _DimSize_ _|_ _Shape_ _|_ _DeprecatedArg_ ) – deprecated alias of the ` shape  ` argument. Will result in a [ ` DeprecationWarning  ` ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning \"\\(in Python v3.13\\)\") if used. \n\n\n\nReturns  : \n    \n\nreshaped copy of input array with the specified shape. \n\nReturn type  : \n    \n\n[ Array ](jax.Array.html#jax.Array \"jax.Array\")\n\nNotes \n\nUnlike [ ` numpy.reshape()  ` ](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html#numpy.reshape \"\\(in NumPy v2.2\\)\") ,  ` jax.numpy.reshape()  ` will return a copy rather than a view of the input array. However, under JIT, the compiler will optimize-away such copies when possible, so this doesn’t have performance impacts in practice. \n\n<::after>\n\n<::before><::after>See also \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n[ ` jax.Array.reshape()  ` ](jax.Array.reshape.html#jax.Array.reshape \"jax.Array.reshape\") : equivalent functionality via an array method. \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n[ ` jax.numpy.ravel()  ` ](jax.numpy.ravel.html#jax.numpy.ravel \"jax.numpy.ravel\") : flatten an array into a 1D shape. \n\n  * <::marker>\n\n[ ` jax.numpy.squeeze()  ` ](jax.numpy.squeeze.html#jax.numpy.squeeze \"jax.numpy.squeeze\") : remove one or more length-1 axes from an array’s shape. \n\n\n\n\nExamples \n    \n    \n    >>> x = jnp.array([[1, 2, 3],\n    ...                [4, 5, 6]])\n    >>> jnp.reshape(x, 6)\n    Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=int32)\n    >>> jnp.reshape(x, (3, 2))\n    Array([[1, 2],\n           [3, 4],\n           [5, 6]], dtype=int32)\n    \n\n<::after> Copy to clipboard \n\nYou can use ` -1  ` to automatically compute a shape that is consistent with the input size: \n    \n    \n    >>> jnp.reshape(x, -1)  # -1 is inferred to be 6\n    Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=int32)\n    >>> jnp.reshape(x, (-1, 2))  # -1 is inferred to be 3\n    Array([[1, 2],\n           [3, 4],\n           [5, 6]], dtype=int32)\n    \n\n<::after> Copy to clipboard \n\nThe default ordering of axes in the reshape is C-style row-major ordering. To use Fortran-style column-major ordering, specify ` order='F'  ` : \n    \n    \n    >>> jnp.reshape(x, 6, order='F')\n    Array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6], dtype=int32)\n    >>> jnp.reshape(x, (3, 2), order='F')\n    Array([[1, 5],\n           [4, 3],\n           [2, 6]], dtype=int32)\n    \n\n<::after> Copy to clipboard \n\nFor convenience, this functionality is also available via the [ ` jax.Array.reshape()  ` ](jax.Array.reshape.html#jax.Array.reshape \"jax.Array.reshape\") method: \n    \n    \n    >>> x.reshape(3, 2)\n    Array([[1, 2],\n           [3, 4],\n           [5, 6]],
