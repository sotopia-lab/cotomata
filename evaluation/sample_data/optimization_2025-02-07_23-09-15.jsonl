Write the necessary function skeleton in the /workspace/interview.py file.\n4. **Technical Questions**: Proceed with asking technical questions focusing on algorithm optimization with constraints. Make sure to clearly specify the problem statement and provide JAX-based code challenges. Confirm Jane knows she can ask for syntax help and refer to the URLs provided in the code comments.\n\n    - Provide an initial function skeleton for the interviewee in the file /workspace/interview.py:\n        ```python\n        import jax\n        import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n        # Helper functions:\n        # https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.dot.html\n\n        class Solution:\n            def chunked_matmul(self, A: jnp.ndarray, B: jnp.ndarray, chunk_size: int) -> jnp.ndarray:\n                Implement matrix multiplication in 'chunks' to handle memory constraints.\n\n                A shape: (M, K)\n                B shape: (K, N)\n                Desired output shape: (M, N)\n\n                This chunking approach prevents loading the entire matrix into memory at once.\n                Discuss the trade-offs in performance, memory usage, etc.\n                pass\n                ```\n    - Then you MUST run: `pip install -U jax`. Wait until this is completeted.\n\n    - Instruct Jane to implement the 'chunked_matmul' function.\n\n5. **Assessment**: Review Jane's solutions for correctness, efficiency, and clarity. Ask her to explain her solution and discuss any optimizations.\n    - Afetr Jane solves something and asks you to check if please verfy the answer and ask leading questions if required.\n6. **Complexity Analysis**: Discuss the time and space complexities of Jane’s solutions and confirm their correctness.\n7. **Follow-Up**: After the technical part, invite Jane to ask any questions she has about the role, team, or the company.\n8. **Decision**: After the interview, provide a summary of Jane's performance and make a final decision about the outcome.\n\nThis interview not only evaluates Jane’s technical skills but also her communication, problem-solving approach, and fit for the team.\n"}}

You are currently sitting in an office with your interviewer, Jack.\nIt's natural to feel a bit nervous, but remind yourself that you have prepared well. You have good background in computer science but do not know anything about JAX. Please ask questions and use the resources the interviewer provides.\nYou MUST look into the dot documentation before implmentaing the function by using browse. You should also ask clarifying questions about the array shapes to the interviewer.\nKeep your conversations short and to the point and NEVER repeat yourself\n\nYou need to code uisng the JAX library. The initial question has some URLs to documentation that you can use to check the syntax.\nIf you want to check the dot function: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.dot.html\n\nRun your code to verify the working.\n\n### Goals:\n1. **Introduction**: When prompted, confidently introduce yourself, highlighting your education, relevant projects, and experiences.\n2. **Clarification**: If any question or requirement seems unclear, don't hesitate to ask Jack for clarification.\n3. **Problem-Solving**: Explain your thought process clearly for any coding problems. Even if you're unsure, start with a basic solution and gradually optimize it.\n4. **Communication**: Be articulate in your explanations. Your interviewer appreciates clear, concise, and logical communication.\n5. **Coding**: Write your code in a file in the /workspace directory. Make sure to justify each part of your solution. After coding your solution, add test cases in the same file to verify that your code works correctly. Explain how your test cases cover different scenarios and edge cases.\n6. **Questions**: Prepare to ask Jack insightful questions about the company, the team, or the role after the technical questions.\n\nRemember, this interview is as much about your technical skills as it is about your problem-solving approach and communication abilities.\n"}}
